Well hello there! I'm Aaron Chapin, and I'm a Game Developer. I'm an American who was born in Stuttgart, Germany, and bounced around a lot as a kid. I went to Drexel University where I got my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Computer Science, and fell in love with Game Development as a profession.

I started my career making Flash games, but have spent the majority of my time working with the Unity game engine. I've worked as a solo developer, a gun-for-hire programmer, part of small indie teams, and even at the largest game developer (at the time) in Germany. So I have a experience wearing lots of different hats and covering lots of different scopes.

My biggest focus is on writing code that is useful and appreciated: whether it's by players, other developers, or even support teams. I always build systems with the end-user in mind, without sacrificing maintainability. Along with my coding tasks, I also enjoy writing about my experiences, and giving talks about the things I've learned throughout my time in the industry.

I'm currently working for Toca Boca in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm on the Central Tech team, where we build tools to help our game developers build the best experiences for our players.
