summary: A level-0 one-shot adventure for an open-source tabletop RPG
---
I learned about the simple RPG [DURF](https://emielboven.itch.io/durf), and was really into the concept, even though I still haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. When the author started the first DURF jam, I was interested in trying it out - as I'd never done a jam for a tabletop RPG before.

There were a couple ideas that I had, but in the end I decided to go for an adventure module. One of the interesting constraints for the jam was that the contents had to be only one page. I was also intrigued by the character creation option to start your characters at "level 0", or proto-heroes. 
So I decided to make a contained adventure module based around level-0 characters, which would mean that I couldn't make anything too hard or lethal, as the players wouldn't have many resources to deal with challeneges. Not to spoil too much, but the plot follows a classic zombie movie plot, climaxing with a battle between two higher-level characters which the PCs have to sort out.
The module's name, DORF, is a play on the fact that "Dorf" is the word in German for village, and the module is set in a small fantasy village. This minor pun may have been the determining factor in making this my jam submission...
