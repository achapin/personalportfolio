## Yarr, Me Hearties!
Duel was an experiment I tried for a turn-based sidescrolling fighting game. Each player has a sword and a shield, and in each round they choose to swing each to cover either their head, torso, or legs. Shields were purely for blocking, but if a sword wasn't stopped by the opponent's sword or their shield, then damage would be done. Players have 10 life, and striking the head did 5 damage, the torso did 3 damage, and the legs did only one damage. However, striking the legs meant that the melee was pushed back a space. If you were pushed back 3 times, your character fell overboard, and you lost the game automatically. Ideally, it was meant to be a single-screen experience, but the control scheme seemed too confusing to continue developing. So it remains as an interesting prototype
