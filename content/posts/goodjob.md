## Rat Racer
As the clumsy child of a CEO, you must climb the corporate ladder one office-themed puzzle at a time! Complete puzzles in multiple ways as you experiment with the interactive environments—a projector can be wheeled gently through an electric door…or catapulted through the wall. So toil (or tumble) your way to the top and make your father proud!

## My Contribugtion
I worked on Good Job! as a Senior Developer at Paladin Studios. I can't say much more because of NDA. The game is out on the Ninentdo Switch, and we're very proud of it.
