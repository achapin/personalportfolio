I was a playtester for Modiphius Entertainment's [Homeworld Fleet Command](https://modiphius.net/pages/homeworld-fleet-command?srsltid=AfmBOoqycAE1gqQLRb2xAsX-HNAb88X-OEjhBJ5fqVKz0rB091HVPtSf) tabletop game. I really enjoyed the experience while testing the game, and purchased my own copy when it was released.

One of the things I enjoy most with games like this is building different competitive and thematic fleets within the restrictions of the force building rules. However, for this game they can be a bit tricky to manage. So I spent some free time putting together a web-based app to let players (including myself) have freedom and usability while making up fleets, but also be aware of the rules restrictions so the creations would be legal.
