## A Mammoth Task
Through the Philly Dev Night events, I was introduced to someone who was looking to build a local multiplayer racing game about jockeys riding on emu-sized birds called "Mammoths". He was an animator by trade, and had developed a series of assets used for a concept video, and wanted to use them in order to make an alpha version of the game in order to see if it was worth moving forward with.

## Jammed Together
Given his goals and the volume of work already completed, we agreed to develop the alpha version of the game during two Saturday "game jam" sessions. I brought on an additional junior programmer to help with some of the more menial development tasks, leaving the client and I to work on the core gameplay. Overall, we had a product that was playable, and the client then took it around to several trade shows. I took a new permanent position not long after that, and never found out if the project progressed further.
