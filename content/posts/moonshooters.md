## A Test Of Skill
When I was interviewing at Goodgame Studios, I was given a relatively straightforward programming test: make a classic SHMUP in Unity. I had finished working on <a href="highlight.php?project=jamestown">Jamestown+</a> not long before, so I had quite a bit of experience with SHMUPs and how to make them interesting. So, even though I had only a few days to turn the project around, I implemented the following features:
- Predefined enemies that flew along custom paths
- A "Story Mode", with designed enemy spawns and a level-end boss
- "Cinematic Camera" in the story mode that would speed or slow the scroll speed based on design
- An "endless mode" where enemies would continually spawn as long as the player was alive
- Several ship variants that fired and flew differently
- Visible damage on the player ship as they got closer to death
- Local high score boards for both game modes

While I was very proud of my accomplishments, I also have to give credit to the art used. I made heavy use of the packs provided for free by <a href="http://kenney.nl/assets">Kenney</a> to give the project a much more professional look.

The game is not available for download, but the project itself is public on [my github profile](https://github.com/achapin/moonshooters)
