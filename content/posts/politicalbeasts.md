## Air Console
The Air Console is a platform where a single host runs the game on a PC in a WebGL container, and players connect to the game on their phones with HTML5-based controllers. A few friends and I decided to make a new game for this platform, originally for their annual game jam, but extending well past that

## Gameplay
Players take the role of different animal politicians running for office. They have to plan their moves ahead-of-time every round in order to intercept neutral donors at a fancy party. By schmoozing with these donors they generate money every round, and whomever ends up with the most money wins!
