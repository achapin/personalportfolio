## High Hopes
While I was working as an independent contractor, I was approached by a friend-of-a-colleague who was looking for someone to digitize a board game that they had published in the '70s, but were updating for a more modern audience. I learned later that this board game was about facilitating a silly session of smoking marijuana. While that isn't one of my vices, I was looking for contract projects and the work was well within my wheelhouse.

## Development
The game had a fairly aggressive timeline for completion, as the re-release of the board game was already scheduled for a particular date in April. So even though we weren't able to realize the client's grandest visions for the digital version, I laid out a proposal to them of what could be accomplished by that deadline, and they were satisfied. I developed the game in Unity to facilitate easy deployments to both iOS and Android, the Apple App Store rejected our submission based on grounds of content. I worked with the client to try to amend the game to meet Apple's guidelines, but they ultimately decided that they did not want to compromise the product.

The game is no longer available, even on the Google Play Store
