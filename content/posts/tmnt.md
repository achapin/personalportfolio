## Turtle Power
Through my contacts at the Philly Dev Night event, I was offered a brief contract job working on a game for Nickelodeon's online games portal for kids. Originally, the client wanted a full 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up game - completed in two months. We told them that wasn't possible, especially with the additional technological constraints required - the game had to be fully localized, and available as both a flash and html5 runnable, using the Flambe engine.

## Fearsome Fighting Team
In order to meet their deadline, we proposed a series of quick minigames that would be chained together and based around the TV episode the game was based on. They agreed, and we quickly went to work. As with any project on such a short deadline there were some hitches, but overall the project met everyone's expectations.
