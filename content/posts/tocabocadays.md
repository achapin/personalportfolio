Toca Boca Days was the first project I worked on at Toca Boca. I initially joined the project as a line Unity Developer - working on features as the game grew larger and larger. Eventually I became the Tech Lead for the Server pod, focusing on building and supporting the server application which runs in the backend, but facilitates gameplay for all connected players.

Days is an ambitious title for Toca Boca - their first multiplayer offering ever. We had to deal with a lot of unique challenges to run a multiplayer game - which comes with that territory. However, we had the added complication of making a multiplayer game specifically for kids and tweens. Our team is very conscientious about the environment our players play in. We want to give them freedom, but also keep them safe.

Like most of my projects, Toca Boca Days is built with the Unity game engine. Even the server application is also running on Unity.

If you would like to try out the game, it is available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/toca-boca-days/id1508157114)
